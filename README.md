Issue 1: Login Service - Error 401 Unauthorized

Issue 2: Dashboard Not Loading - 504 Gateway Timeout

Issue 3: API Submission Failure - 500 Internal Server Error

Conclusion

## Issue 1: Login Service - Error 401 Unauthorized
Problem Analysis
Users reported encountering an Error 401 Unauthorized message when attempting to log in. The issue was intermittent and affected some users during peak traffic times.

Solution Steps
Investigated Authentication API: Upon inspection, it was found that the authentication API was rejecting valid credentials due to a timeout error with the authentication server.

Server Configuration Adjustments: We increased the timeout duration and optimized the authentication server's load balancing to handle peak traffic.

Enhanced Session Management: Implemented token refresh logic to avoid session expiration during login attempts.

Resolution Confirmation
After implementing these changes, the issue was resolved, and users were able to log in successfully without encountering the 401 error.

$$ Issue 2: Dashboard Not Loading - 504 Gateway Timeout
Problem Analysis
The Dashboard was failing to load for some users, triggering a 504 Gateway Timeout error. This was impacting access to real-time data and analytics.

Solution Steps
Checked Server Logs: Logs indicated that the API call to fetch dashboard data was timing out due to slow server response times.

Optimized API Calls: Rewrote inefficient queries to improve response time and added pagination to the dashboard data to reduce the payload size.

Caching Implementation: Introduced caching for the most commonly accessed dashboard data to improve load times.

Load Balancing Adjustments: Improved the server infrastructure with better load balancing to handle high traffic without resulting in a timeout.

Resolution Confirmation
After implementing these optimizations, the dashboard began loading within the expected time frame, and the 504 error was no longer observed.

## Issue 3: API Submission Failure - 500 Internal Server Error
Problem Analysis
When users attempted to submit data through the platform's API, some experienced a 500 Internal Server Error. The issue was affecting critical operations, leading to failed submissions.

Solution Steps
Analyzed API Logs: We found that a bug in the backend caused a failure in data submission due to incorrect validation of incoming requests.

Fixed Validation Logic: We corrected the validation logic in the API, ensuring that all submitted data was properly sanitized and validated before being processed.

Improved Error Handling: Enhanced the error handling mechanism to provide more informative error messages and prevent the server from crashing.

Resolution Confirmation
After deploying the fix, API submissions were successfully processed, and no further 500 Internal Server Errors were reported by users.

## Conclusion
All the issues described in this document have been successfully resolved through targeted analysis and implementation of the proposed solutions. The fixes have been validated, and users have reported improved performance, including:

Successful logins with no 401 errors.

Faster loading of the dashboard with no 504 errors.

Reliable API submissions with no 500 errors.

The changes have been deployed and thoroughly tested in the production environment.
